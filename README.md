# Zephelin - Zephyr AI Profiling Library

This repository hosts sources of Zephelin, the Zephyr AI Profiling Library.

## Getting started

Install `west` with `pip`:

<!-- name="pip-init" -->
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, initialize the workspace using `west`:

<!-- name="west-init" -->
```shell
west init -l .
west update
west patch apply
west zephyr-export
west packages pip --install
west sdk install
source zpl_env.sh
```

## Building samples

Run the following command:
<!-- name="build-samples -->
```shell
west build -p -b max78002evkit/max78002/m4 samples/events/named_event
```

## Convert the trace

The library produces traces in CTF (Common Trace Format), which in order to be visualized, have to be converted to TEF (Trace Event Format).

This can be achieved with `west zpl-prepare-trace` command, which automatically prepares an environment (with combined metadata from Zephyr and Zephelin, defining available events), converts the trace and processes custom event:

```bash
west zpl-prepare-trace [-h] -o OUTPUT [--zephyr-base ZEPHYR_BASE]
                       [--tflm-model-path TFLM_MODEL_PATH]
                       [--tvm-model-path TVM_MODEL_PATH]
                       [--build-dir BUILD_DIR]
                       [--zephyr-elf-path ZEPHYR_ELF_PATH]
                       ctf_trace
```

## Setting up USB device permissions for Zephelin

To use the USB backend and its associated `west zpl-usb-capture` command
seamlessly, use the following udev rule in e.g.
`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-zpl-usb-access.rules`:

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0456", ATTRS{idProduct}=="aa55", MODE="0666"
```

You might need to reload udev rules and trigger them manually like so:
```bash
udevadm control --reload-rules
udevadm trigger
```
